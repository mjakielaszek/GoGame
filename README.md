# Go Game
### A simplified version of a Chinese board game - Go. Players take turns placing stones on the board. If a player's stone is surrended from each side with opponent's stones it is captured. 
### In the implemention it is possible to start a game with handicap - that is some stones of one of the players are put on the board before the start of the game. It is also possible to save and load the game.
### The Ko Rule - prevents repetitions of the state of the board. Means that a player cannot ever immediately repeat a position of just captured stone.
### The ko file is an examplary save of the game.
### The program is written in C/C++ in a procedural way.
